Behavior of Hunting vs. scavenging coyotes

This project ran from October 2019 â€“ November 2020. Eight pairs of coyotes at the Millville predator research facility were divided into two groups. A control group that was scatter fed following facility procedures and a treatment group that was fed via a prey model 3 days per week. We conducted behavioral observations and tests on both groups to monitor changes in behavior due to the treatment. We conducted monthly focal observations, and quarterly novel object, puzzle box, and conspecific tests. This folder contains 9 data files related to these tests.

All Months Car Summary.csv
Each month, we conducted four 15-minute focal observations during feeding times with the prey model. This file contains the amount of time (seconds) that coyotes spent in each behavior during these observations. The behaviors are aggression, eating, foraging, locomotion, neutral social behavior, play, resting, standing, interacting with the prey model, investigating the prey model, other, out of sight, scent marking, and stereotyping. Each row is one observation for an individual coyote and also contains the date and month of the observation.

AllMonthsNoCar.csv
Each month, we conducted four 15-minute focal observations during non-feeding times and four observations during feeding times without the prey model. This file contains the amount of time (seconds) that coyotes spent in each behavior during these observations. The behaviors are aggression, eating, foraging, locomotion, neutral social behavior, play, resting, scent marking, standing, carrying pup (CP), nursing, other, out of sight, aggression towards pups, playing with pups, and stereotyping. Each row is one observation for an individual coyote and also contains the date and month and whether it was a feeding or nonfeeding observation.

AllMonthsConspecific.csv
Every three months, we presented the coyotes with a dummy coyote to test their response to a unknown conspecifc. This file contains the amount of time (seconds) that coyotes spent within 5m and 1m of the dummy, and behaving aggressively, playfully, or touching the dummy. Each row also contains the date of the observation, the pair each individual belong too, the subject, the total observation length, and the month of the observation. 

AllMonthsConspecifcLatency.csv
Every three months, we presented the coyotes with a dummy coyote to test their response to a unknown conspecifc. This file contains the latency, in seconds) for coyotes to approach within 5m and 1m of the dummy, and behave aggressively, playfully, or touch the dummy. Each row also the pair each individual belong too, the subject, and the month of the observation. If coyotes did not display a behavior during the observation, the latency is fixed at 3600 seconds, the length of the observation.

AllMonthsNovel.csv
Every three months, we presented the coyotes with a novel object to test their boldness. This file contains the amount of time (seconds) that coyotes spent within 5m, 1m, and touching the object. Each row also contains the date of the observation, the subject, the total observation length, and the month of the observation. 


AllMonthsNovelLatency.csv
Every three months, we presented the coyotes with a novel object to test their boldness. This file contains the latency (in seconds) for coyotes to approach within 5m, 1m, and touch the object. Each row also contains the subject and the month of the observation. 

AllMonthsPuzzle.csv
Every three months, we presented the coyotes with a multi-access puzzle box for 10 days to test their innovation. This file contains the amount of time (seconds) that coyotes spent within 5m, 1m, interacting with and touching the puzzle box. Each row also contains the total length of the observation, the pair, subject, day of the trial, and month. The solve column in this dataset does not contain meaningful data.

AllMonthsPuzzleLatency.csv
Every three months, we presented the coyotes with a multi-access puzzle box for 10 days to test their innovation. This file contains the latency (in seconds) for coyotes to approach within 5m, 1m, interact with, touch, and solve, the puzzle box. Each row also contains the pair, subject, and month of the observation.

AllMonthsScentMark.csv
Each month, we conducted four 15-minute focal observations during non-feeding times and four observations during feeding times without the prey model. This file contains the number of times each coyote was observed scent marking during these observations. It also includes the subject, whether it was a feeding or non-feeding observation, and the month of the observation.
